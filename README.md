# Sheppard Software Geography Leaderboards

This is a compilation of leaderboard stats for the geography speedgame SSG. All
data comes from its [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/ssg) entries. This
project is merely for a convenience. All requests are made by the client using
SR.com's API; no data is saved anywhere.
